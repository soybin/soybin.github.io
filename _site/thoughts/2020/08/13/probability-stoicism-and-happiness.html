<p><strong><em>What are the chances of you tossing a coin and getting heads?</em></strong></p>

<p>Well, 50% is the obvious answer.</p>

<p>Different coins from different countries have different physical attributes; some of them differ in weight distribution, shape, size and overall aerodynamic capabilities. Those slight variations may affect the likelihood of you getting heads.</p>

<p>To get to the point in your life where you have to toss a coin, a lot of things must’ve happened. If we start taking in count the odds for every event in your life that lead you to that exact moment, the odds of you throwing a coin and getting heads一or cross一get very close to absolute zero.</p>

<p>The chances for the kinds of events discussed so far happening can be more or less estimated. But there are events for which we can’t, as humans, possibly estimate the chances of. For example, what are the odds of <em>you</em> being who <em>you</em> are? or, what are the odds of the universe we’re in right now being created in the first place? The idea of calculating the probability for these events is simply ridiculous. Perhaps part of the reason is that we don’t deeply understand what these events really imply, or perhaps not even Gods know why they’re alive. If that were to be the case, what makes you any different from a God?</p>

<p>I don’t like feeling like everything is an absolute mess and nonsense chaos so, at times, I like to think about the universe as a game. The only thing a game needs in order to exist are a set of rules, so here are my rules to the universe一at least the ones that apply to me; a player:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Everything is randomly decided and has no reason to be.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, it could be worse.</p>
