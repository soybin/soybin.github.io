After properly implementing these techniques, and throwing some iterative fractals into the mix, I developed [**_idyll_**](https://github.com/soybin/idyll), a fractal engine that can create beautiful renders like the following:  

![*fractal rendered with idyll using raymarching and path tracing*](/images/idyll/first.png){:width="100%"}
![*fractal rendered with idyll using raymarching and path tracing*](/images/idyll/second.png){:width="100%"}
![*fractal rendered with idyll using raymarching and path tracing*](/images/idyll/third.png){:width="100%"}
