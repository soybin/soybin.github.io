# {{ page.title }}

I should have learnt how to deal with low-level memory manipulation and graphics rendering way earlier in my career as a developer, in fact, it's one of the few things I regret; not starting earlier. People new to programming often think about these concepts as something that only a few brave programmers have to deal with so that the rest can enjoy the commodities and comfort that high-level abstraction brings.  

See, when you learn some kind of api or a videogame engine, you're learning a set of very specific concepts and methods designed―most of the times―only to be used in those predefined environments.  

It's no surprise, and to be expected, that a big chunk of the software development community just have no clue about what they're doing. I'm not talking about any platform/technology in particular, but just taking a look at 

I suggest that understanding the simplest concepts underlying that often over-abstracted and obfuscated technology will always give you a broader view on its possibilities.
